Hello there! In case you haven't already, extract the folder "CSS-Colored-Markers-release" to somewhere on your computer, 
then open up "Sites" and double click on the file "Primary Colors.html" to go onto the first page. Also, don't touch anything else from this folder, 
as that might break some stuff on the website. Other than that, have fun!
