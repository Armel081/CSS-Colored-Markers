# CSS Colored Markers

## About
A little mock-up site i created mirroring the CSS Markers site from [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) beta Responsive Web Design curriculum, which i made for my own practicing purposes. All rights reserved to their respective owners.

### INSTRUCTIONS

Go to the <ins>[**Releases**](https://github.com/Armel081/CSS-Colored-Markers/releases)</ins> page,, download the latest version of the ``` CSS-Colored-Markers-release.zip``` file, extract the ```CSS-Colored-Markers-release``` folder, then open up `Sites` and click on  ```Primary Colors.html``` to get started on the first page. Also, don't touch anything else from the folder, as that may cause elements on the page to break and/or not load correctly.
